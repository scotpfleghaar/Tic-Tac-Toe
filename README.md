## Tic-Tac-Toe
> JavaScript By Scot Pfleghaar

In this project, I built a functional, two-person Tic Tac Toe game. I used the provided mockups, HTML, CSS and image files to create a game that requires players to add their names, take turns adding an X or O to the game board, and announce when the game ends. I kept track of the state of the game -- whose turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.

I used a basic implementation of the Module Pattern and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.
